This document provides an overview of the processes involved in Data Acquisition and Data Wrangling. These are essential steps in preparing raw data for analysis, ensuring that it is accurate, consistent, and usable.
Step-by-Step Process:
Importing Libraries and Loading Data: 
Important   libraries to be used
• Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool 
• NumPy is used for working with multidimensional arrays
Initial Data Exploration:
Display the first few rows of each dataset to understand their structure.
Display summary statistics.
Data Cleaning:
Handling Missing Values- Check for missing values. Fill or drop missing values as appropriate.
Correcting Data Types- Correct data types if necessary. 
Removing Duplicates-Remove duplicates if any.
Data Transformation:
Standardize categorical values
Normalize numerical values if necessary.
Merging Datasets:
Merge the datasets based on common columns 
Feature Engineering: 
Create new features if necessary, such as aggregating counts or creating interaction terms.
Final Dataset Preparation:
Ensure the final dataset is ready for further analysis or modeling.
